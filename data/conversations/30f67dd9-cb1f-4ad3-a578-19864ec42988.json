Avoid defining patterns within method bodies.\n\nFor Velocity templates, directly access POJO properties without using getters/setters. For boolean variables, use `isXxx()` methods; for Boolean objects, prioritize `getXxx()` methods.\n\nWhen passing variables to the page, use `$!{var}` syntax. Be aware that `${var}` will display null or non-existent values on the page.\n\nUse `Math.random()` with caution, as it returns a double value between 0 and 1. For integer random numbers, use `Random` objects instead.\n\nTo retrieve current milliseconds, use `System.nanoTime()` or `Instant` classes (recommended for JDK8).\n\n**Best Practices**\n\nAvoid complex logic in view templates; stick to displaying data.\n\nSpecify sizes when constructing or initializing data structures to prevent memory leaks.",
